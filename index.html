            <p>I am a moody girl. I get angry for no reason. I misunderstand my bf unnecessarily. But I understand that mistake again but then i feel very bad. I cry a lot then. In fact, my mind gets bad then I know how to treat everyone.</p>

            <h2><span class="name-highlight">Please be quiet</span></h2>
            <p>Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. Silence isn't empty, it's full of answes. Whatever Allah has left in the density of a man that was the gift for u. but also best options for your life. That's called luck. So always thankful to Allah.</p>
